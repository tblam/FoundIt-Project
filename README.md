# FoundIt-Project

To open website, begin at home.html. This is FoundIt's homepage. To use the website, click any of the links in the navigation bar. You can sign up or sign in to an account.

To begin your housing search, use the map provided on the home page to browse available homes. If you wish to learn more about a particular home, click on a blue flag and follow the link provided with the pricetag. Red flags display locations of criminals/criminal activities, and graduation caps show locations of schools.

Once you click on a home you wish to learn more about, basic information about the home and location will be provided, as well as photos if the seller provides them.

NOTE: FoundIt is still a work in progress, and most of the map features are placeholders for when FoundIt's geospatial map and database are implemented and integrated. 

TODO: 
- Account/forum functionality
- Geospatial tools and database implementation/integration
- Further development on front-end
