Import and Export data examples from DB2-LUW client to DB2 zOS server using CLP:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Execute the following db2 commands sequencially or write in a script file named clp.sh and execute it.

$ cat clp.sh
db2 -v "uncatalog node tcpec27"
db2 -v "catalog tcpip node tcpec27 remote LABEC27.vmec.svl.ibm.com server 446 ostype mvs"
db2 -v "uncatalog db EC27"
db2 -v "catalog db STLEC1 as EC27 at node tcpec27 authentication dcs"
db2 -v "connect to EC27 user newton using <db_password>"
db2 -v "create table mytab1 (name varchar(20), id int)"
db2 -v "insert into mytab1 values('bimal',22)"
db2 -v "insert into mytab1 values('mohan',23)"
rm -rf datafile.ixf
db2 -v "export to datafile.ixf of ixf select * from mytab1"
db2 -v "select * from mytab1"
db2 -v "import from datafile.ixf of ixf insert into mytab1"
db2 -v "select * from mytab1"
db2 -v "drop table mytab1"
db2 -v terminate


We can get following output when we run the above script file:
$ clp.sh

Also, I would like quote following line from db2-luw infocenter regarding the import and export command:
http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r7/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.luw.apdv.api.doc/doc/r0001957.html
DB2 Connect can be used to import data to DRDA servers such as DB2 for OS/390, DB2 for VM and VSE, and DB2 for OS/400. 
Only PC/IXF import (INSERT option) is supported. The restartcnt parameter, but not the commitcnt parameter, is also supported.
